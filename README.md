 UI Engineer Test: Cats & Dogs
You are to create a Single Page JavaScript Application to display GIF results from Giphy's
developer API  https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI .
The application should include the following features:


● A control to show latest Cats or Dog results (no search field needed).
● Results view with paging of 25 GIFs per page.
● A detail view which shows the selected GIF when clicked/hovered/interacted with.
You are free to use any JavaScript technology to implement this solution (React, Ember, Vue, Angular or just plain JavaScript).
You should treat your code as if it were going into production, so some tests and appropriate comments are expected.
We would like you to implement your own design without utilising any third-party CSS frameworks. Use of CSS methodologies is encouraged.
Feel free to impress us, by going above and beyond scope; implement any extra features you like.
